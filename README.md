## Data
I got the all the data using the api endpoint: https://controllerdata.lacity.org/resource/pggv-e4fn.json
The data sometimes took ages, so I decided against ajax and stored the necessary data in json files. I stored the data unformatted.

I format the data in javascript. I would prefer to do this on the backend, but the instructions said js,html,css.

## Tools Used
- D3 - I have never used D3 before, but I have been wanting to take a stab at it for a while.
- Bootstrap - Just for the basic layout.
- jQuery - For odds and ends, probably could have done without it.
